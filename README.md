# EDP - Empirical Dynamic Programming
We merge recently developed tools from machine learning
and nonlinear dynamics to construct and evaluate near-optimal policies in multi-species systems. Specifically, a non-parametric model for the dynamics is estimated from time series data using Gaussian process-based dynamic modeling. A policy is then derived from the inferred dynamics using a temporal difference learning
algorithm.

# Get started
Two tutorials are available. Run edp_tuto_1.mlx for optimal control of a 2-species system and edp_tuto_2.mlx for optimal control of a 2-species system given data on the first species only.

# To Do
- Add new control rules
- Solve compatibility issues

# Citing and publications
